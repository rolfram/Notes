abstract = "The electron temperature gradient mode has been proposed to be a source of experimentally relevant electron thermal transport, via a variety of non-linear phenomena such as the generation of streamers. The question of streamer stability and saturation is revisited, with the effects of geometry and perturbation stability highlighted. It is shown that the streamer saturation level is not determined by the balance of Kelvin–Helmholtz rate vs. linear growth rate, but by balancing the non-linear Kelvin–Helmholtz drive against damping mechanisms of the Kelvin–Helmholtz perturbation, suggesting a significantly lower streamer saturation level. In addition, random shear suppression of ETG turbulence by drift-ion temperature gradient (DITG) modes is studied, and it is found that streamers will be sensitive to shearing by short-wavelength DITG modes. An additional interaction mechanism, modulations of the electron temperature gradient induced by the DITG turbulence, is considered and shown to be quite significant. These considerations are used to motivate a discussion of the requirements for a credible theory of streamer transport."

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {The transport of heat in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas is dominated by the complex nonlinear dynamics of plasma turbulence. In magnetically confined plasmas used for fusion energy research, turbulence is responsible for cross-field transport that limits the performance of tokamak reactors. We report a set of novel gyrokinetic simulations that capture ion and electron-scale turbulence simultaneously, revealing the dynamics of cross-scale energy transfer and zonal flow modification that give rise to heat losses. Multi-scale simulations are required to match experimental ion and electron heat fluxes and electron profile stiffness, establishing the applicability of the newly discovered physics to experiment. Importantly, these results provide a likely explanation for the loss of electron heat from tokamak plasmas, the ‘great unsolved problem’ (Bachelor et al (2007 Plasma Sci. Technol. 9 312–87)) in plasma turbulence and the projected dominant loss channel in ITER.}
