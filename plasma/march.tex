\subsection{How do Tokamaks work and also fusion?}
For understanding this refer to \cite{dini2009overview}. Then write down thoughts here.

\subsection{Work thus far with pseudo-spectral code.}

\subsection{What is Vlasov description of plasmas?}

\subsection{What is an inverse cascade?}

\subsection{What is multiple-scale analysis?}

\subsection{What is Landau damping?}

\subsection{What is a thermal avalanche?}

\subsection{How does the D-11 Tokamak work at UCSD?}

\subsection{How does Turbuelnce affect fluid heat transport?}
Read the following document: \cite{1992ApJ...388...64W}
